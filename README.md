# Tableau-ZAR-vs-ZWE-Covid19-visualization
In this project I am using Tableau for the first time to visualize Covid-19 data between two countries South Africa and Zimbabwe. I draw maps for both countries to visualise the number of cases in various locations. 
There is an exponetial growth in South Africa for the number of deaths due to covid-19 while in Zimbabwe the number of deaths over time have been linear.
